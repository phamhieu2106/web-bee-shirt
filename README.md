Website Bee Shirt is a sales management system for a clothing store, supporting both in-store and online sales. The website allows users to manage products, orders, customers, promotions, and product returns. It also provides statistical reports to help store owners track business performance. The project uses modern technologies such as Java Spring Boot for the backend, Angular for the frontend, and MySQL for the database.
